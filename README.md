# Embedded Linux Dev

Symbol autocompletion, function and symbol navigation. Supports C, Kconfig, defconfig, .config and device tree files. Plus some automation to match device tree compatibles and open their respective driver or documentation files.

## Requirements

The extension works on Linux systems, also tested on WSL, and uses some 
packages for its correct operation. Before use you must install the following 
dependencies on your system:

- bash
- universal-ctags

An important detail is to install universal-ctags and not exuberant-ctags to have support to index Kconfig and device tree files.

For a complete development experience for the Linux kernel development, during
the installation of the extension, the following extensions will be required to
be installed together:

- [DeviceTree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=plorefice.devicetree) (syntax highlighting for device-tree .dts e .dtsi files)

## Features

All features of the extension can be accessed by clicking commands through the
activity bar:

In the next topics, I will describe each of the extension features.

### üß™ Experimental Device Tree Source Engine

> A new DTS Engine parser is in testing phase. This does not use ctags and it has a totally different behavior showing hints and lookups just for the included files.

To use new DTS Engine add the following to your `settings.json`:

```json
    "kerneldev.experimental.newDtsEngine": true
```

Changing this configuration and saving will automatically reload the extension to make effect.

Also make sure to remove the `DTS` from the `ctags.languages`. The default configuration is:

```json
    "ctags.languages": [
        "C",
        "C++",
        "DTS",
        "Kconfig",
        "Make"
    ],
```

The new DTS Engine uses the `yaml` binding documentation to have completion tips and validation. The extension needs to know a valid path to documentation. If you are opening the root folder from Linux Kernel source code add the following to your `settings.json`:

```json
    "devicetree.bindings": [
        "${workspaceFolder}/Documentation/devicetree/bindings"
    ],
```

### Device Tree Doc From Compatible

In a device-tree file, ".dts" or ".dtsi", or in a device driver file ".c", mouse
click on a "compatible" string and select the command. VS Code will open the
corresponding documentation file for the compatible:

This functionality can also be selected from the right click context menu:

### Device Driver From Compatible

In a device-tree file, ".dts" or ".dtsi", mouse click on a "compatible" string
and select the command. VS Code will match and open the code file, ‚Äú.c‚Äù, from
the driver that implements compatible:

This functionality can also be selected from the right click context menu:

### ARM/ARM64 dts/dtsi From Include

In a device-tree file, ‚Äú.dts‚Äù or ‚Äú.dtsi‚Äù, mouse click on the string of a
device-tree include and select the command. VS Code will open the corresponding
file:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microhobby/linuxkerneldev/master/docs/dtsinclude.gif)

This functionality can also be selected from the right click context menu:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microhobby/linuxkerneldev/master/docs/dtsincludecontext.gif)

There are two options for this command, one for ARM and other for ARM64, because
the devices-tree files for each of these archs are on different paths.

### Linux Include From Selected

In ".c", ".dts" or ".dtsi" file, mouse click on an include string and select the
command. VS Code will open the corresponding include:

This functionality can also be selected from the right click context menu:

### Generate CTags

Last but not least. This functionality generates a ‚Äú.vscode-ctags‚Äù file in the
root folder that has been opened. This file is the tag index generated by
universal-ctags. This file is required to generate the project code navigation:

- Jump to definition:

- Code completion:

- Mouse hover tags:

## Acknowledgment

The work here was only possible because of the [Exuberant CTags](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chriswheeldon.exuberant-ctags) extension, which I used as a base. Thanks Chris Wheeldon.

Thanks also to Trond Einar Snekvik who did a great job in creating a [syntax highlighting for Kconfig](https://github.com/trond-snekvik/vscode-kconfig) that I am using here.
